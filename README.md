# 🛰️ Invisible Air: PM2.5 Emissions Across California Metros

This project visualizes and compares **PM2.5 pollutant concentrations** across three major California metropolitan areas—**Bay Area**, **Los Angeles**, and **San Diego**—using data from **CalEnviroScreen 4.0** and **TIGER/Line Primary Roads**. The goal is to analyze spatial patterns in air pollution relative to urban infrastructure and visualize localized disparities across regions.

## 📍 Study Areas
- **Bay Area**: Includes Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties.
- **Los Angeles Metro**: Centered on Los Angeles County.
- **San Diego Metro**: Focused on San Diego County.

## 📦 Data Sources

| Dataset | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **CalEnviroScreen 4.0** | Census tract-level environmental health screening tool; includes PM2.5 values | [OEHHA - CalEnviroScreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) |
| **TIGER/Line Primary Roads (2021)** | U.S. Census Bureau shapefiles for major roadways | [Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html) |

## 🧪 Goals
- Visualize fine-scale spatial disparities in PM2.5 across urban California
- Highlight infrastructure-adjacent air quality differences
- Provide compelling, comparable graphics for public communication or environmental reporting
